# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration for Legal AI Training

> **Implementation**: Our integration of MCP servers directly into reinforcement learning training episodes for legal AI, enabling agents to learn optimal search strategies alongside legal reasoning.

## What is MCP and Why We Use It

### Model Context Protocol Overview

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is Anthropic's standardized framework that enables large language models to securely connect to external data sources and tools through a unified interface. Unlike simple API calls, MCP provides:

- **Stateful Interactions**: Maintains conversation context across multiple tool calls
- **Dynamic Resource Discovery**: Models can discover and utilize available tools
- **Secure Integration**: Standardized protocols for safe external resource access
- **Efficient Communication**: Optimized message passing between models and tools

### Our Innovation: MCP During Training

**Traditional Approach:** Train Model → Deploy Model → Add Tools at Inference

**Our Approach:** Train Model + Tools Together → Deploy Integrated System

**Key Advantage:** Agents learn effective search strategies during training rather than fumbling with tools only at inference time.

### 1. CourtListener MCP Server

**Purpose:** Provides access to comprehensive legal case law and judicial information during training.

**Data Sources:**
- **10+ Million Legal Opinions**: Federal and state court decisions
- **Judicial Information**: Judge profiles, court hierarchies, jurisdiction details
- **Case Metadata**: Citations, dates, court levels, legal topics
- **Citation Networks**: Precedential relationships between cases

**Training Benefits:**
- **Strategic Case Law Research**: Agents learn when to search specific courts vs. broad queries
- **Jurisdiction-Aware Searching**: Learn to target appropriate court levels
- **Citation Following**: Develop skills in following precedent chains
- **Temporal Legal Research**: Learn to find current vs. historical legal standards

### 2. Brave Search MCP Server

**Purpose:** Provides general web search capabilities for broader legal research context.

**Search Capabilities:**
- **Current Legal News**: Recent developments affecting legal practice
- **Regulatory Updates**: New legislation, policy changes, administrative rules
- **Legal Commentary**: Academic articles, legal blogs, professional analysis
- **Contextual Information**: Background information supporting legal research

**Training Benefits:**
- **Complementary Research**: Learn when legal databases aren't sufficient
- **Current Context**: Access to recent developments not in historical case law
- **Regulatory Awareness**: Understanding current regulatory environment
- **Multi-Source Validation**: Cross-referencing legal database findings

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Install MCP framework
pip install mcp

# Install legal database clients
pip install courtlistener-api
pip install brave-search-api
```

### 2. API Configuration

**CourtListener Setup:**
```bash
# Register for CourtListener API access at: https://www.courtlistener.com/api/
export COURTLISTENER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

**Brave Search Setup:**
```bash
# Register for Brave Search API at: https://api.search.brave.com/
export BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 3. Start MCP Servers

```bash
# Start CourtListener MCP Server
python mcp_servers/courtlistener_server.py --port 8000

# Start Brave Search MCP Server  
python mcp_servers/brave_server.py --port 8001
```

### 4. Run Training with MCP

```bash
python train_with_mcp.py \
    --config config/mcp_training.yaml \
    --mcp-servers courtlistener,brave \
    --output models/mcp_legal_agent_v1/
```

## Learning Patterns During Training

### Tool Usage Evolution

**Early Training (Episodes 1-100):**
- Random tool selection
- Poor query formulation
- No strategic sequencing

**Mid Training (Episodes 500-1000):**
- Begins preferring CourtListener for legal precedents
- Learns basic jurisdiction targeting
- Develops simple search refinement

**Advanced Training (Episodes 2000+):**
- Strategic tool sequencing (CourtListener → Brave for context)
- Jurisdiction-aware tool selection
- Complex query optimization

**Expert Level (Episodes 5000+):**
- Sophisticated search strategies
- Tool coordination patterns
- Professional-grade research workflows

### Optimal Search Strategy Patterns

**Precedent Research:**
1. Search CourtListener for case topic
2. Search CourtListener for jurisdiction-specific cases
3. Search Brave for recent developments

**Statutory Analysis:**
1. Search Brave for statute text
2. Search CourtListener for statute interpretation
3. Search Brave for recent applications

**General Consultation:**
1. Search Brave for topic overview
2. Search CourtListener for relevant cases
3. Search Brave for practical guidance
